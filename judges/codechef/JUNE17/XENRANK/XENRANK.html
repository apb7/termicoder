<p>Xenny reverse-engineered all the binaries released by the International Security Agency (ISA)
during summer vacation just to pass time. As a reward, the ISA gave him infinite ByteCoins.</p>

<p>Out of sheer boredom and a sense of purposelessness in life, Xenny decided to arrange the Coins on a 2-Dimensional Euclidean Plane.
The boredom was so strong that he arranged these coins in a specific pattern, as opposed to the usual, monotonous way of storing coins in a Piggy Bank.</p>

<p>On each integer co-ordinate (x, y) where x ≥ 0 and y ≥ 0, a single coin was placed. And each coin was assigned a rank. The following pattern was followed in the arrangement:</p>

<p>Let's denote the co-ordinates of the k<sup>th</sup> coin by (x<sub>k</sub>, y<sub>k</sub>) and its rank by R<sub>k</sub>.</p>

<p>
For any 2 coins i, j:
</p>

<p>
if <b>(x<sub>i</sub> + y<sub>i</sub>) < (x<sub>j</sub> + y<sub>j</sub>) or ( (x<sub>i</sub> + y<sub>i</sub>) == (x<sub>j</sub> + y<sub>j</sub>) and x<sub>i</sub> < x<sub>j</sub>)</b>
</p>

<p>
then <b>R<sub>i</sub> < R<sub>j</sub></b>. We sort all the coins by this comparison.
</p>

<p>
The index of the coin (C) in this sorted list of coins (1-indexed) is its rank.
</p>

<p>Each query is as follows: Given <b>(U, V)</b>. Among the coins that are lying on or inside the rectangle with
its diagonal end-points being <b>(0, 0)</b> and <b>(U, V)</b>,
which is the coin that has the maximum rank?</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
The first line contains an integer, <b>T</b> - the number of testcases.</p>
<p>
Each testcase contains 2 space-separated integers: <b>U</b>, <b>V</b>.
</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
For each testcase, print the rank of the maximum ranked coin, on a new line.

<h3>Constraints</h3>
